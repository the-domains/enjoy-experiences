# Waking Up to Good Taste

CBTL's 26th St. Bistro serves up warm, artisan breakfasts for cold, dreary mornings

****

**Haute Interiors 
**

Across Metro Manila, plastic snowmen smile amid fields of faux-snow. A legion of kings and shepherds flock to very many mangers, paying frozen homage to clones of baby Jesus. Winter is coming, and perhaps it's these reminders that make getting up early much more difficult. Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf's 26th St. Bistro concept gives bleary-eyed diners a reason to awake, wide-eyed, thank to its eye-catching interiors. Customers enter on hardwood planks and marble tile. Above them, fans whirr, suspended from a ceiling of patterned tin tiles. Rattan wall accents, wrought iron table foot claws and an elegantly stocked liquor bar are just a few of the elements that cocoon diners in an haute environment designed for BGC's chic clientele.
